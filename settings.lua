dofile("data/scripts/lib/mod_settings.lua") -- see this file for documentation on some of the features.

-- This file can't access other files from this or other mods in all circumstances.
-- Settings will be automatically saved.
-- Settings don't have access unsafe lua APIs.

-- Use ModSettingGet() in the game to query settings.
-- For some settings (for example those that affect world generation) you might want to retain the current value until a certain point, even
-- if the player has changed the setting while playing.
-- To make it easy to define settings like that, each setting has a "scope" (e.g. MOD_SETTING_SCOPE_NEW_GAME) that will define when the changes
-- will actually become visible via ModSettingGet(). In the case of MOD_SETTING_SCOPE_NEW_GAME the value at the start of the run will be visible
-- until the player starts a new game.
-- ModSettingSetNextValue() will set the buffered value, that will later become visible via ModSettingGet(), unless the setting scope is MOD_SETTING_SCOPE_RUNTIME.
